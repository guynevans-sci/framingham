This allows me to grade your answers accurately.  **Hey, did you read that?**  Every question, sub-question, and sub-sub-question gets its own answer.  Recall that I hand out **Problem Sets**.  You submit **Answer Sets**.  If I have to look around your solutions to find the answers, you are missing the point.  Make your answers clear,thoughtful, and full.\n",

On the rare occasion wherework done “by hand” is needed, you can use copier on campus to convert your work into pdfs.  A Google search on “free pdf assembler” returned 6.4x10<sup>6</sup> hits.

    "This exercise leads to the answer to the question “How many atoms are there on Earth?”  How would  you  start  to  answer  this  question?   Sometimes,  a  more  tractable  question  leads  to  some insight.  For example, the average mass of living humans is around 64 kg<sup>1</sup>.  You learned in CHEM 107 the crucial relationship between mass, moles and number:  \n",

As it happens, the average atomic weight of the human body is about that of O = 16 amu."
